### Getting Started
I made this project while learning the GO programming language 

This project follows:

- [Simple blog for sharing Go - robusta](https://github.com/pthethanh/robusta) (mentor's)

*Objective*: Create a web application that people can share news and content or comment on other peopleâ€™s posts (basically a Reddit clone :) )
*Techs use*: GoLang, MongoDB, Docker

**Note** that this project now is in active development, but do not hesitate to make a pull request.
